   Hi, I am Sean (aka Binyomin) Cohen.  I learned in different yeshivas (institutions devoted to
   Jewsih law analysis) for a number of years,
   got married, had some kids, and looked for a career change.  I was always fascinated by computers, and I decided
   I didn't want to just learn how to be proficient at using the latest programs.  I wanted to know how to make those programs.
   I got excited by the potential that technology has to make the world a more productive plave, and I decided - "This is for me".

   I got a bachelor in Judaic Studies, to formalize my education, while taking an elective course in java.  I went on to self-educate
   a bit more and then got a job at BH PHoto.  I then started some android development more seriously through Udacity.com's nanodegree program.
