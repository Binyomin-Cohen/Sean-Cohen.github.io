<h5>Background</h5>
<p>
   Hi, I am Sean (aka Binyomin) Cohen.  I learned in different yeshivas (institutions devoted to
   Jewish law analysis) for a number of years,
   got married, had some kids, and looked for a career change.  I was always fascinated by computers, and I decided
   I didn't want to just learn how to be proficient at using the latest programs.  I wanted to know how to make those programs.
   I got excited by the potential that technology has to make the world a more productive place, and I decided - "This is for me".

<h5>Education</h5>

<p>
   I got a bachelor in Judaic Studies, to formalize my education, while taking an elective course in java.  I went on to self-educate
   a bit more and then got a job at <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com">BH Photo</a>.  I then started some android development more seriously through Udacity.com's nanodegree program.

</p>

<h5>Experience</h5>
<p>
  So, my current job - creating and maintaing the APIs for the BH Photo mobile team...
