<h3>Basics</h3>
<div class="baseSection">
<p>
   Hi, I am Sean (aka Binyomin) Cohen.  I learned in different yeshivas (institutions devoted to
   Jewish law analysis) for a number of years,
   got married, had some kids, and looked for a career change.  I was always fascinated by computers, and I decided
   I didn't want to just learn how to be proficient at using the latest programs.  I wanted to know how to make those programs.
   I got excited by the potential that technology has to make the world a more productive place, and I decided - "This is for me".
</p>
<p>
  <b>In short I learned to be proficient in: </b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>JSON and XML (for those who would like to see this spelled out even though it is usually included in the above)
</ul>

<h3>Education</h3>
<div class="baseSection">

<p>
   I got a bachelor in Judaic Studies, to formalize my education, while taking an elective course in java.  I went on to self-educate
   a bit more and then got a job at <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com">BH Photo</a>.  I then started some android development on
   the side, played around with python, learned some more computer-sciency-things like data structures and algorithms,
    and developed a true passion for just learning anything about software development.

<h3>Experience</h3>

<img src="BH.png">
<p>
  So, my current job - creating and maintaing the APIs for the BH Photo mobile team...

  <br>
  I deal with a complex, soundly designed architecture of object oriented java.
    I code the java servlets that deal with the CRUD operations on our Oracle SQL database, manipulating
    the results of any queries, passing it on to the various architectural components of our ecommerce site,
    parsing it into JSON, and returning it to the front end.  I am responsible for communicating any API changes and
    gathering the requirements when it comes to new APIs requested from other teams and divisions.
